# Temperature Screening System using Facial Recognition

This is the system that will collect thermal images and collect temperature data points of all
person who enter the any premises using smart camera and an infrared thermometer gun.
Upon collecting the data (continuous process), the AI engine will constantly analyze the data,
match it using the facial recognition notified and asked to see doctor to get the complete
checkup.
As soon as the pattern of changing temperature is observed for any person, the institute and the
person notify itself and asked to see doctor to get the precautions.
Once it start collecting the data for all the people on the ongoing basis, the AI engine will be
able to predict the changing temperature patterns and help person to avoid spared of any
contiguous diseases like COVID-19.
In the case of such diseases, the system will be able to reverse track the source and all the other
people who may have been affected using AI and the data history.
