# Temperature Screening System using Facial Recognition

## Overview
The Temperature Screening System is designed to enhance health and safety measures by utilizing advanced AI technologies. It combines thermal imaging, facial recognition, and temperature data collection to monitor individuals entering a premises. The system aims to detect abnormal temperature patterns, predict potential health risks, and help in preventing the spread of contagious diseases like COVID-19.

### Components of the System
1. Smart Camera: Captures facial images and identifies individuals using facial recognition technology.
2. Infrared Thermometer Gun: Measures body temperature of individuals.
3. AI Engine: Analyzes collected data to identify patterns and potential health risks.
4. Database: Stores historical temperature data and facial recognition information.
5. Notification System: Alerts individuals and institutions when an abnormal temperature pattern is detected.
## Methodology
1. Data Collection
Facial Recognition: When an individual enters the premises, the smart camera captures their facial image. Facial recognition software matches this image against a database of stored images to identify the person.
Temperature Measurement: Simultaneously, the infrared thermometer gun measures the individual’s body temperature. This temperature data, along with the time and the identified individual’s information, is sent to the central database.
2. Data Storage
Database: The system stores all collected data points, including facial images, identified individuals, temperature readings, timestamps, and any detected patterns. This database is crucial for historical analysis and pattern recognition.
3. Data Analysis
AI Engine: The core component of the system is the AI engine, which continuously analyzes the incoming data. The engine employs machine learning algorithms to:
Pattern Detection: Identify abnormal temperature patterns that may indicate a health risk.
Predictive Analysis: Predict future temperature trends for individuals based on historical data.
4. Anomaly Detection
Thresholds: Predefined temperature thresholds are set within the system. If an individual’s temperature exceeds these thresholds, the AI engine flags it as an anomaly.
Continuous Monitoring: The AI engine monitors temperature data in real-time, allowing for immediate detection of abnormal patterns.
5. Notification and Response
Immediate Alerts: When an anomaly is detected, the system sends instant notifications to both the individual and the institution.
Doctor Consultation: The notified individual is advised to consult a doctor for a comprehensive health check-up.
6. Preventative Measures
Disease Spread Prevention: By analyzing temperature patterns, the system can identify early signs of contagious diseases. It helps in taking preventive measures to avoid the spread of such diseases within the premises.
Contact Tracing: In case of a confirmed contagious disease, the system can backtrack the individual’s interactions and identify other potentially affected individuals using the historical data.
